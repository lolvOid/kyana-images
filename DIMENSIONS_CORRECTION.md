## Key Measurements

### Total Device Height/Thickness:
```
Core Device Only:          10mm
Core + Ring Frame:         ~12-13mm (includes ring frame)
With Powerbank on Strap:   +8mm to strap section
```

### Full Assembly:
```
FLAT Configuration:
- Length: ~210mm (straps extended)
- Width: 33mm (device)
- Height: 10-13mm (device + ring)

CIRCULAR Configuration:
- Diameter: 60-70mm (wearable circle)
- Circumference: 210mm
- Device height: 10-13mm
```

## Updated Documentation Files

All files have been corrected with **10mm** core device thickness:

✅ **RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md** - Updated all references
✅ **C4D_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Updated dimensions section
✅ **DIMENSIONS_SCALE_GUIDE.md** - Updated scale calculations
✅ **README_DOCS.md** - Updated key numbers

## Impact on Camera Distances

### No Change Needed!
The camera distances remain the same because they're based on the **width/length** of objects, not thickness:

```
Full Assembly FLAT:     300-350mm (based on 210mm strap length)
Full Assembly CIRCULAR: 180-220mm (based on 60-70mm diameter)
Core Device Only:       80-100mm (based on 33mm width)
Closeups:              60-80mm (macro range)
```

The 10mm thickness vs 8mm thickness **doesn't significantly affect** camera positioning since:
- Camera orbits horizontally around the device
- Framing is based on width (33mm) and length (210mm)
- The 2mm difference in thickness is minimal for camera setup

## C4D Scene Setup Notes

### In Cinema 4D:
```
1. Core Device Object Size: 33mm × 33mm × 10mm
   - X: 33mm (width)
   - Y: 33mm (height) 
   - Z: 10mm (thickness) ← UPDATED

2. Camera Spline Radius: No change needed
   - Full Assembly: 325mm radius
   - Core Only: 90mm radius

3. Camera Height: No change needed
   - MID: +30-50mm
   - LOW: -40mm
   - HIGH: +100mm
```

---

## What Changed:

**Before:** Core Device = 33mm × 33mm × **8mm**
**After:** Core Device = 33mm × 33mm × **10mm**

**Difference:** +2mm thickness

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Technical specs corrected
- ❌ No camera distance changes needed
- ❌ No render plan changes needed

---

## Summary

The core device is **10mm thick**, not 8mm. This has been corrected in all documentation files. Your camera setup and render plan remain unchanged since the distances are primarily based on the device width (33mm) and strap length (210mm), not the thickness.

**You're all set to start rendering with the correct dimensions!** 🎬
