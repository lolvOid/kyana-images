## Caption Guidelines

### State Encoding
- Always explicitly state sensor status: "sensors active", "sensors inactive", "sensors off", "LED glow visible", "no LED glow"
- Always explicitly state clasp position: "open position", "closed position", "unsecured", "securing"
- Always explicitly state powerbank state: "standalone", "attached", "mounted"

### Factual Consistency
- Core device: Always "33mm square form factor"
- Biometric sensors: Always "eight chrome sensors in circular pattern, four red LED sensors smaller, four green LED sensors bigger"
- Copper pins: Always "six copper connector pins on top edge, pins arranged on left, right, and middle sections"
- Strap sensors: Always "six small flexible sensors underneath each strap from ring edge"
- Finish: Always "black metallic matte finish" or "black matte metallic finish"

### Avoid Marketing Language
- Do not use: "premium", "luxury", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "innovative"
- Do not use: "stunning", "beautiful", "elegant", "sleek"
- Use factual descriptors: "professional product photography", "technical closeup", "precision engineering"

### Background Consistency
- Always end with: "professional product photography, white background" or "professional product photography, studio lighting, white background"
