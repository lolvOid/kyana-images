## Key Measurements

### Component Dimensions:
- **Core Device**: 30mm × 30mm × 10mm
- **Ring Frame**: 33mm × 33mm × 7mm
- **Full Device**: 33mm × 33mm exterior, 10mm max thickness
- **Powerbank**: 8mm thick cube
- **Strap Total**: 210mm when laid flat

### Camera Distances (Updated):
- **Full Assembly FLAT**: 300-350mm (based on 210mm strap length)
- **Full Assembly CIRCULAR**: 180-220mm (circular form ~60-70mm diameter)
- **Core Device Only**: 70-90mm (for 30mm device)
- **Ring Frame Only**: 80-100mm (for 33mm ring)
- **Closeup Details**: 50-70mm (macro shots)

## Why These Specific Sizes

### Core Device (30mm × 30mm × 10mm):
- **30mm × 30mm**: Screen size, small enough to fit comfortably
- **10mm thick**: Houses all electronics, battery, sensors

### Ring Frame (33mm × 33mm × 7mm):
- **33mm × 33mm**: 3mm larger than core = 1.5mm gap per side for magnetic fitment
- **7mm thick**: Thinner than core, provides structural frame
- **Inside**: 4 magnetic connectors hold 30mm core
- **Top**: 6 copper pins for powerbank charging

### Assembly:
- Core (30mm) snaps into ring (33mm) via 4 magnetic connectors
- Core thickness (10mm) protrudes 3mm above ring (7mm)
- Ring provides structural attachment for straps
- Straps attach to ring sides, not core directly

## Updated Camera Setup for C4D

### Core Device Renders:
```
Object: 30mm × 30mm × 10mm
Camera Distance: 70-90mm
Framing: Device fills 80-90% of frame
```

### Ring Frame Renders:
```
Object: 33mm × 33mm × 7mm
Camera Distance: 80-100mm
Framing: Ring fills frame, shows inner space
```

### Full Assembly Renders:
```
Objects: Core (30mm) + Ring (33mm) + Straps (210mm)
Overall Size: 33mm width (ring exterior)
Camera Distance: 300-350mm
Framing: Full watch with extended straps
```

## Documentation Updated

All files corrected with these dimensions:

✅ **RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md** - All render specs updated
✅ **C4D_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference corrected
✅ **DIMENSIONS_SCALE_GUIDE.md** - Scale calculations updated
✅ **README_DOCS.md** - Key numbers corrected

---

## No Changes Needed For:

❌ **Camera distances for full assembly** - Still 300-350mm (based on 210mm strap length, not device size)
❌ **Camera distances for circular** - Still 180-220mm (based on circular diameter)
❌ **Render plan phases** - Same sequence and structure
❌ **Animation timings** - Same frame counts

---

## Critical Points to Remember

1. **Core device is 30mm**, not 33mm
2. **Ring frame is 33mm**, surrounds the 30mm core
3. **Core is 10mm thick**, ring is 7mm thick
4. **Overall exterior dimensions**: 33mm × 33mm (ring defines outer size)
5. **Camera distances unchanged** for most renders (based on strap length, not device size)
6. **Core device camera distance adjusted**: 70-90mm (was 80-100mm)
