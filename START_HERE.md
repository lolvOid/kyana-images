## Your Product Dimensions (Remember These)

```
Core Device:  30mm × 30mm × 10mm (fits inside ring)
Ring Frame:   33mm × 33mm × 7mm (holds core)
Straps:       80mm + 130mm = 210mm total
Powerbank:    8mm thick
```

## 📖 Which File Do I Read?

**Right now, you only need ONE file:**

### 👉 **RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md**
This has EVERYTHING you need to start rendering.

**The other files are optional references:**
- `C4D_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Keep open while working in C4D
- `CAPTION_TEMPLATES.md` - Use AFTER rendering (for captions)
- `TRAINING_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Use AFTER rendering (for training)

**Ignore these for now:**
- ~~DIMENSIONS_CORRECTION.md~~ (outdated)
- ~~FLAT_VS_CIRCULAR_GUIDE.md~~ (extra info)
- ~~DIMENSIONS_SCALE_GUIDE.md~~ (extra info)
- ~~WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md~~ (too detailed)
- ~~README_DOCS.md~~ (index file)

## ⚡ Quick Start (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Open Cinema 4D
Set units to millimeters

### Step 2: Build Your Scene
```
Core Device:    30mm × 30mm × 10mm
Ring Frame:     33mm × 33mm × 7mm (around core)
Place at world origin (0, 0, 0)
```

### Step 3: Set Up Camera
```
Create circular spline at origin
Radius: 325mm
Add camera to spline
Enable "Align to Spline"
Camera height: +40mm
```

### Step 4: Test First Render
```
Render 1 frame
Check if device fills 70-80% of frame
If too big: increase radius
If too small: decrease radius
```

### Step 5: Start Phase 1 Rendering
Open `RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md` and go to **"PHASE 1 - ESSENTIAL PRODUCT SHOTS"**

Start with:
1. **FULL_ASSEMBLY_FLAT_MID_360** (36 frames)
   - All parts assembled, straps flat
   - Camera: 325mm radius, +40mm height
   - Render frames 0-35

That's it! Just do that first render.

---

## 🎯 Your First Day Goal

**Just render ONE sequence: FULL_ASSEMBLY_FLAT_MID_360**
- 36 frames (frames 0-35)
- Camera orbits 360° around the watch
- Watch stays still, straps extended flat

If this works, you're ready to continue!

---

## 📋 After Your First Render Works

1. Check frames look good ✓
2. Continue with Phase 1 renders (RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md)
3. After rendering Phase 1+2, use CAPTION_TEMPLATES.md
4. After all rendering done, use TRAINING_SETUP_GUIDE.md

---

## 🆘 Quick Help

**Camera too far away?**
→ Reduce spline radius (try 250mm)

**Camera too close?**
→ Increase spline radius (try 400mm)

**Device not in center?**
→ Make sure device is at (0, 0, 0) in C4D

**Don't know what to render?**
→ Open RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md, Section: "PHASE 1"

**Need quick C4D settings?**
→ Open C4D_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

---

## 🎬 Bottom Line

**Today:** Just render your first 36-frame sequence in C4D
**Tomorrow:** Continue with more Phase 1 renders
**Next week:** Add captions and start training

**Don't overthink it. Just start rendering!** 

Open **RENDER_PLAN_C4D.md** → Go to **Phase 1** → Render **FULL_ASSEMBLY_FLAT_MID_360**

That's your only task today. ✨
